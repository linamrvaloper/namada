# Validator restaking script

***Script functionality:***
- Profit Optimization: Automatically claims and restakes validator & delegation rewards, compounding the stake and increasing potential earnings
- Security Enhancement: Supports network security by contributing to proof-of-stake

***Operational Algorithm:***
- Claims any available rewards for the validator and bonds them back to the validator, enhancing their total stake
- Identifies and claims rewards for all bonded tokens across all validators delegated to, rebonding them to your validator
- Additionally checks the balance to keep it higher than customizable minimum threshold or not to take any actions if initially the balance is too low
